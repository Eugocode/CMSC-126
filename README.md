# CMSC-126: Web Development

This project is a requirement for our course in CMSC 126: Web development. 

Eugo Farm website has a banner, about us, blog, product, and contact sections. This project aims to implement front-end (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) and back-end (PHP, MySQL) development while enforcing the Scrum methodology. It is limited to at least one webpage and one read and write to the database (XAMPP was used as a database and local server).

P.S. Few commits were made since this project was uploaded right after the development.
