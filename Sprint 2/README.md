Activity: Web Development

**Sprint 2**:

This is my 2nd sprint in developing a web application. The second sprint focuses on front-end development. HTML, CSS, and JavaScript codes of the web application are written. Also, a few changes were made to the website's wireframe to limit it to only one page and have a feature of one read and write to the database as per the instructor's request. The second sprint is discussed in the Scrum pdf file.
